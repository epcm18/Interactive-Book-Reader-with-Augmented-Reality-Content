# PIXIE: Interactive Reading Platform with Augmented Reality Content

## Introduction

PIXIE is an innovative interactive book reader with augmented reality (AR) content, specially designed for children aged 3-10 years. The main goal of this project is to revolutionize the way children engage with learning and reading. By incorporating AR visualizations into children's books, the mobile app aims to create an immersive and enjoyable reading experience. We believe that this technology will inspire young readers to fall in love with reading and learning while having fun.

## Scope

PIXIE is a comprehensive platform that includes both a mobile app and a web app. The mobile app allows users to read e-books with AR content visualization, utilize text-to-speech features, and perform actions such as highlighting, commenting, and bookmarking. On the other hand, the web app provides a platform for publishers to upload AR content for sale and allows users to purchase books. Additionally, the web app supports functionalities such as user registration, login, and profile management.
